# go-workshop

Collection of golang reference examples for teaching and learning golang. These examples assume no experience with backend and avoid complex tooling. [Golang](https://golang.org/) is an excellent language that is simple yet incredibly powerful and fast. Its useful for any new development as it makes devops a breeze (compiles to a single executable) and avoids the tooling and framework issues of other languages (you can get started with just the language and the standard library, vs having to learn tooling and frameworks that are required with many languages).  

## Golang

These examples are pure golang exercises

1. [Simple REST api](https://github.com/peterlamar/go-workshop/tree/master/rest-example)
2. [RPC](https://github.com/peterlamar/go-workshop/tree/master/rpc)
3. [Timing](https://github.com/peterlamar/go-workshop/tree/master/timing)
4. [Gin Swagger](https://github.com/peterlamar/go-workshop/tree/master/ginswagger)

## Golang + Docker

These integrate with other components such as databases, stood up with docker containers.

1. [Redis](https://github.com/peterlamar/go-workshop/tree/master/redis)
2. [db-cache](https://github.com/peterlamar/go-workshop/tree/master/db-cache)
3. [Hello Casandra](https://github.com/peterlamar/go-workshop/tree/master/hellocassandra)

## Golang + Docker + Kubernetes

These interact with Kubernetes as well as Docker. Local [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/) or a cloud hosted kubernetes can be used for this exercise. 

1. [2-tier Kubernetes web app](https://github.com/peterlamar/go-workshop/tree/master/webdata)
